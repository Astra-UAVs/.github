**Astra UAVs – Innovating the Skies**

Astra UAVs is a passionate and forward-thinking drone, UAV, and robotics hobbyist group based at **Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College**, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, India. Formed by a collective of dedicated engineering students and drone enthusiasts, our mission is to innovate, build, and deploy intelligent aerial systems that can solve real-world problems across various domains — from autonomous navigation to disaster response.

### Our Origins: From Hobby to Innovation

Our journey began with hands-on experimentation using widely available multirotor frames such as the **S450**, **S550**, and **Tarot 680**. What started as a fascination with flight control, brushless motors, and PID tuning soon grew into a deeper pursuit of autonomy, mission-specific drones, and real-world applications.

Through trial, error, and relentless improvement, we evolved from simple DIY builds to creating full-fledged autonomous aerial systems, designed and engineered from the ground up to meet specific performance and mission criteria.

### Breakthrough: ISRO Robotics Challenge 2025

Our first major breakthrough came when we were selected to participate in the prestigious **ISRO Robotics Challenge – University Edition 2025 (IRoC-U 2025)**. The challenge, organized by the Indian Space Research Organisation, aimed to simulate extraterrestrial mission scenarios such as autonomous navigation and exploration on the Martian surface.

For this competition, we developed an advanced **Autonomous Navigation Aerial Vehicle (ANAV)** powered by **Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO)** and **SLAM**. Our UAV featured custom software and hardware integration to perform precise **arena scanning**, **autonomous landing zone detection**, and complex **mission execution without external navigation aids** — a critical requirement in GPS-denied environments.

This project not only deepened our knowledge of perception, path planning, and onboard autonomy, but also validated our potential to compete and innovate at a national level.

### Present Focus: NIDAR 2025 – Revolutionizing Disaster Management

Currently, Astra UAVs is proud to participate in **NIDAR 2025**, a prestigious competition launched by the **Drone Federation of India (DFI)**. NIDAR — which stands for **National Innovation for Drone-based Applications in Resilience** — is a nationwide drone innovation challenge aimed at strengthening India's capabilities in **Disaster Management, Search & Rescue, Emergency Response, and Humanitarian Aid**.

Our team is competing under the **Disaster Management and Rescue theme**, where we are building a robust, rapid-deploy UAV platform capable of:

* **Aerial victim detection** using AI-powered image processing
* **Terrain mapping in disaster-struck zones** via onboard photogrammetry and depth sensing
* **Live telemetry and secure communication** for real-time decision-making by emergency response teams
* **Payload delivery and rescue aid drops** to inaccessible regions

Our platform also integrates **environmental sensors**, **thermal imaging**, and **autonomous navigation** to operate under challenging weather and visibility conditions, making it ideal for post-earthquake, flood, or fire rescue operations.

### Vision & Impact

Astra UAVs envisions a future where **unmanned aerial systems** play a pivotal role in improving human life — not just for research or recreation, but as life-saving, mission-critical tools. With every competition and project, we push ourselves closer to our goal: **to become a leading name in mission-specific UAV innovation in India**.

We aspire to make meaningful contributions to the **Indian Drone Ecosystem**, and ultimately develop solutions that aid **public safety**, **national resilience**, and **technological self-reliance**.
